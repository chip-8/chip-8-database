    "description": "13. VIP Biorhythm\n\nThe theory of Biorhythm states that there are thre predominant cycles that can influence\nhuman behavior.  These include a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle and a\n33-day intellectual cycle.  All three cycles start at birth and continue throughout life.\n\nEach cycle consists of a positive and a negative period.  Physical, Emotional and\nIntellectual aspects are enhanced during positive periods.  Poor performance is\nindicated by the negative period of a cycle.\n\nA critical day occurs on the crossover from the positive to the negative period or\nvice versa.  A critical day indicates instability in a particular aspect.\n\n\nHow to Use VIP Biorhythm\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and\n   the game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\n\n3. Enter birthdate using 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year.\n\n4. Enter start date using 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year. The start date\n   indicates the first day of the 32-day Biorhythm chart the program will generate.\n\n5. After a period of calculation proportional to the span of time involved, the three\n   cycle curves will be shown for a 32-day period.  Each horizontal bit position\n   represents one day in the cycle.  The start day, on the left, and every seventh\n   day are indicated by week markers.  The first day of a positive or negative period\n   is a critical day.\n\n6. To advance the start date, hold key F down until the desired date is reached.\n   To decrement the start date, hold key B down.  These functions allow changing the\n   start date slightly without reentering all the dates and waiting for the calculations\n   to be preformed.\n  \n7. Press Key 0 to clear the screen and enter a new set of dates.\n\n   \n\n   See VIPG1-13.jpg\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\n\t\t\tPhysical\t\tEmotional\t\tIntellectual\n\nPositive Period\t\tStrong, \t\tGood moods, \t\tGood Judgement\n(Up)\t\t\tVigorous\t\tCooperative\t\tSharp Mentally\n\nNegative Period\t\tTire easily,\t\tLow Enthusiasm,\t\tLow attentiveness\n(Down)\t\t\tLess Stamina\t\tFeelings Subdued\tand concentration\n\nCritical Days\t\tSusceptible to injury\temotionally unstable,\tPoor memory,\n(Crossover)\t\tor Illness,\t\tUpset easily\t\tProne to mistakes\n\t\t\tLow endurance\n",

    "title": "Lunar Lander",
    "description": "15. Lunar Lander\n\nYou are descending to the floor of a 250-foot crater.  The right side of the TV display\nshows amount of fuel, feet from bottom and fall rate per cycle.  Lenght of fall rate\ncycle changes from about 1/4 second to one second.  The fall rate increases by one\nfoot per second/per cycle.  The computer will update the display only at the end of\neach cycle.\n\nThe left side of the display shows the Lunar Lander descending from 250 feet.  The\nLander will first appear at one of sixteen locations.  It will then slowly drop down\nthe crater.  The crater walls have rock formations protruding from them which must\nbe avoided.  If either rocket motor should touch any part of the crater, the Lander\nwill explode in a cloud of smoke and disintegrate.  (Remember, these are atomic\nthrusters and react like miniature atomic bombs upon impact).\n\nWhen you reach 32 feet, the display will change, and you will see the crater floor.\nYou must now ladn between the rock formations on the floo and maintain a minimum fall\nrate.  As you drop your fall rate to zero, you soon discover that the Lander becomes\nmore and more unstable just as any hovering object would.  And now with perfect skill\nyou guide the ship in for a perfect touch down, or?\n\nHow to Play VIP Lunar Lander\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and teh game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Key 2 controls the thrust of the Lunar Lander.  One tone beep equals one pound\n   of fuel and one foot of thrust.\n\n3. Key 4 controlls the horizontal stabilizing engine,  and moves the Lander one\n   foot to the left per one pound of fuel.\n\n4. Key 6 controls the stabilization to the right.\n\n5. Stabilization controls only react after: (a) a complete fall cycle, or (b) after\n   the Key 2 thrust control is pressed.  You must be aware of this at all times or\n   you will crash even though either key 4 or 6 is pressed.\n\n6. At the end of each cycle, the Lunar Lander will move randomly at the rate of one\n   foot either right or left.  Therefore, as the fall rate approaches zero, the Lander\n   becomes more uncontrollable, and your horizontal stabilizers react more quickly.\n   (Just like the real thing).\n\n7. If you land too fast, the Lander will bounce and flip over.\n\n8. If you run out of fuel, the Lander will crash.\n\n9. You will not be allowed to go above 250 feet.  If you try to do so, you will just\n   waste precious fuel.\n\n10. Once you reach 32 feet and move into the landing display, you will not be allowed\n    to rise above 26 feet.  Trying to do so will waste more precious fuel.\n\n11. Game options\n  \n    You may select one of three options at the begining of the game.\n\n    Option 1: You start at 250 feet.  You are given 150 pounds of fuel.  You must land\n              at 5 feet per second or less.  The initial descent display is easy to\n              maneuver through.\n\n    Option 2: You start at 250 feet.  You have 200 pounds of fuel.  You must land at 3 feet\n              per second or less.  The initial descent display is hard to maneuver through.\n\n    Option 3: You start at 32 feet.  You have 100 pounds of fuel.  You must land at 3 feet\n              per second or less.  This display allows you to practice landing.  \n\n    You should consider Option 2 as the complete game when trying for Astronaut Ratings.\n\n12. Astronaut Ratings\n\n    The computer will award you with ratings depending on how good a lander you are.\n\n    You will obtain the rating of Astronaut by landing without regard to fall rate or\n    fuel.  You must not exceed fall rate, or zero fuel.\n    \n    You will obtain the rating of Astronaut Pilot, by ladning with regard to fuel.  80\n    pounds or more if you land between the two rock formations on the floor, and 50\n    pounds or more if you land between the crater wall and a rock formation.\n\n    You will obtain the rating of Astronaut Captain by landing the ship with regard to\n    fuel as per above and if the fall rate is two feet per second or less.  (Not an\n    easy task, as you will soon discover).\n\n13. About Graphics\n\n    This game has some interesting graphic displays when you run out of fuel, crash,\n    land too fast, when you land successfully.  I will leave them to your discovery,\n    as they are fun to watch.\n\n14. Landing Sites\n\n    The final landing display will appear somewhat like the illustration below\n    (VIPG1-15.jpg).  You may land in any of the three locations pointed to.  To land\n    between the crater walls and rock formations, you will have to first bring the\n    Lander to a zero fall rate while hovering in the center landing area.  Then bring\n    the ship up and just over the rock formation, and let it drop down to the landing\n    site.  At the last moment, a few taps on the thruster button will slow the lander\n    to the required fall rate.  It will take you many tries to land here, but don't\n    give up, it can be done!!\n\nNOTE:  VIP Lunar Lander requires at least 3K of RAM.

This game is distributed by Invicta Plastics, Suite 940, 200 - 5th Ave., New York, NY 10010, and is available most pLaces where toys and games are sold.\nFor complete details of the game, please refer to their instructions. The information given here refers to this particular VIP iurplementation.\nThe two versions are essentially the same except that the first has a four number code and the second has a five  nr:mber hidden code selected at random..  In the four number version, the digits one through six are used and in the five  number version the diglts zero through seven are used.\nWhile the game is running, the other hex keys, except key F, have no effect. Key F is used when you change your mind and want to change your input. This key erases the current partial entry.\nThe game starts by displaying a series of dashes arranged in rows. As the game progresses, the player attempts to  deduce the hidden code by replacing the dashes with digits entered via the hex keyboard. Each tlme a hex key is used, the selected digit replaces a dash in  one vertical column. This vertical column is one guess of the ten allowed to deduce\nthe hidden number. When the bottom dash in any column is replaced by a digit,  that try is imidiately scored. This score appears below the current column. If any digit in the column exactly matches the hidden number digit in the same row, a broken bar will appear. then four or five (one for each row in the game) appear, the hidden number has been deduced\nand it will be revealed at the right end of  the screen. If any digit in the column matches a hidden digit, but in an incorrect erorr, a white bar will appear. Note that the scoring is across all rows. For example, if there are two fives in a column and one of then is in the correct row and there is only one five in the hidden numbers, one broken bar will appear.\nWhen all allowed ten tries  have been used, the hidden number will be revealed. \n\n",

There is always at least one path through the maze.\n\nHow To Play VIP Most Dangerous Game\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpretor at 0000-01FF\n   and the game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\n\n3. Hunted's turn:\n   When the arrow appears in the lower left, it is the hunted's turn.  Keys 2-4-6-8\n   control direction (up-left-right-down, respectively).  The hunted continues to\n   move until a) he makes 5 moves, b) he hits a wall or c) key 0 is pressed.\n\n4. Hunter's turn\n   When the arrow appears in the lower right, it is the hunter's turn.  The hunter's\n   turn consists of two modes, the move and the shoot.  Keys 2-4-6-8 and 0 control both\n   modes.  Like the hunted, the hunter continues to move until a) he makes 3 moves,\n   b) he hits a wall or c) key 0 is pressed.  If he hits the wall, case b), he cannot\n   fire a bullet.  The hunter may fire one of his bullets using the direction keys\n   2-4-6-8.  The bullet will travel four squares in the corresponding direction, unless\n   a wall is encountered.  If the hunter prefers not to use a bullet, he must press key 0.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until:\n   a) The number of turns (upper left on the display) expire.  The hunted wins.\n   b) The hunter lands on or shoots the hunted.  The hunter wins.\n   c) The hunted lands on hunter, thereby giving up.  The hunter wins.\n   d) The hunted reaches the lower right corner of the maze with at least 1 move\n      remaining in his turn.  The hunted wins, by escaping the maze.\n\n6. Variations of VIP Most Dangerous Game may be played by changing certain bytes in\n   the program.\n\nLocation Default Meaning\n0215\t 0F\t Number of turns in the game.\n0217\t 06\t Number of bullets hunter has at start.\n0219\t 03\t Number of moves per turn for the hunter.\n0221\t 01\t Number of squares per move (hunted and hunter).\n022B\t 05\t Number of moves per turn for the hunted.\n024B\t 01\t If zero, walls are invisible.\n0355\t 04\t Number of squares a bullet will go.\n04E3\t 70\t Probability (out of 100Hex) of a wall appearing.\n04EB\t FE\t If FF, a wall may appear at previously tested boundaries.\n",

I wanted to see if there is a chance that zero will show up as the random number, and it turns out it can. Anyway, when you run the program, it brings a random number up on the screen. When you press any of the keys, it brings another random number up on the screen. This goes on until you quit the program. Address 0x202 holds the C0FF instruction, which commands the CHIP-8 interpreter to set V0 to a random number with the mask 0xFF. This yields 256 different possible numbers (0-255). If C0FF is changed to something like C00A, then the mask will change. This would yield 11 different possible numbers (0-10).",

    "description": "6. VIP REVERSI\nReversi is a game over 100 years old, which has become popular recently under the\nname Othello.  The game is played on a 8x8 square, using two kinds of markers.\nIn VIP Reversi one player has the open markers and the other player the solid\nmarkers.  The score for either player at any time is the total number of his markers\non the square.\n\nHow to play VIP Reversi\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpretor at 0000-01FF\n   and the game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\n\n3. The 8x8 square will be formed and the starting marker configuration shown, having\n   two of each kind of marker in the center four locations of the square.  The starting\n   score for each player is shown as 02 above a line of his markers.\n\n4. Your VIP indicates the player's turn by blinking that player's score and also blinking\n   a cursor dot in the 8x8 square.  A player moves the blinking cursor dot in the 8x8\n   square by pressing the direction keys 1-4 and 6-9 as shown. (VIPG1-6.JPG)\n\n5. When the cursor-dot is properly located, the player presses key 5 to place his marker\n   on the square.  You will find that your VIP will not allow you to make a non-valid\n   play.  The only placements allowed are onces for which at least one of the other\n   player's markers is surrounded between an existing marker of your own and your new\n   marker being placed.  All these markers must be in consecutive positions on the\n   square and can be in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction.  Once a new\n   marker has been placed, your VIP will change all such surrounded markers of the\n   other player to your kind and change the scores.\n\n6. Sometimes it may not be possible for a player to make a valid move.  If this happens\n   he must forfeit his move by pressing the \"F\" key! The game ends when neither player\n   can play or when the 8x8 square is completely filled with markers.  The goal is to\n   end the game with the highest score.  Do not be discouraged if during the game you\n   seem to be losing because this is a game with dramatic reversals!  Develop a winning\n   strategem and become a champion!!\n",

    "description": "14. VIP Programmable Spacefighters\n\nProgrammable Spacefighters is a combat game involving 2 to 8 spaceships competing\nfor the domination of a contained field in space.  The field of play is a \ntwo-dimensional representation of an oblong spheroid.\n\nThe movement and fire of each spacefighter is controlled by programming a series of\ncommands into each fighter's instruction storage table.  Once all the spacefighters\nare programmed, they carry out their commands by sequentially executing a single step\nat a time.  The play of the game ins divided into rounds.  Each spacefighter may\nexecute between 1 and 15 commands per round.\n\nThe fighters all have the same appearance and capabilities.  Players distinguish\nbetween fighters by examining the defense strength and position of their fighters\nat the begining of every round.\n\nEach fighter may face in any of 8 directions.  All firing and forward movement\noccurs in the direction the fighter is currently facing.  As a spacefighter crosses\noutside the two-dimensional field of play, it wraps around and re-enters on the\nopposite side of the field.  Laser bursts terminate when they travel outside the\nfield or hit a target.\n\nEach round consists of a selected number of steps.  Each step is executed in 2 parts.\nDuring the first part, every spacefighter wishing to fire may execute a fire operation.\nThe defense strength of any fighter which is hit by a laser burst is reduced by 1\nand a small flash appears.\n\nAfter all fighters have had an opportunity to execute fire instructions, the movement\npart of the step begins.  Any fighter which has had its defense strength reduced to 0\nis destroyed and a longer flash appears.  The defense strength is changed to a special\ncode so that the fighter will no longer be programmable or take part in the execution\nphase.  The destroyed fighter will still be open to examination during the Defense/\nPosition Check phase.  Fighers having a defense strength greater than 0 may execute\na movement command if there is one.  Breaking each step into 2 such parts removes any\nstrategic advantage to moving first.\n\nThe nature of the game, in that there are variable parameters and no fixed victory\nconditions, allows the players a lot of freedom.  Two to eight players can command\nsingle fighters.  Four or less players can each command multiple fighters.  Two\nfleets could complete to destroy their opponents' flagship first.  Handicaps can\nbe implemented through an imbalance of fighters in different fleets.  An odd number\nof players can play in a free for all or team game.  In a non-combat approach, a full\ncomplement of space fighters could be programmed to preform in kaleidoscope or other\ntype formations.\n\n\nHow to Play VIP Programmable Spacefighters\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and\n   the game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\n\n3. Initalization of Game.\n   Various parameters are entered at the start of the game to determine the number\n   of spacefighters and other aspects of play.\n\n   S: Enter number of spacefighters.  1 to 8 spacefighters may be used.  The program\n      will adjust invalid enteries to the nearest valid number.\n\n   D: Enter defense strength.  A spacefighter may be hit from 1 to F times by laser\n      before being destroyed.\n\n   E: Enter number of command entries.  A spacefighter may be programmed with 1 to F\n      commands during the programming phase of each round.\n\n   C: Enter clock duration/no clock.  A timer clock 1 to F phorseks in duration may\n      be selected.  Each phorsek equals 4 seconds.  The clock is not enabled if a 0\n      is entered.  The clock time is the time allowed for each fighter to be set up.\n\n   F: Enter fire power available.  A spacefighter may be allowed to fire 1 to F\n      laser bursts per round.\n\n   A: Enter accumulation/no accumulation.  A spacefighter may be allowed to accumulate\n      all unused laser bursts by entering 1 to F.  Accumulation is not allowed if a\n      0 is entered.\n\n4. Presentation of Field and Spacefighters.\n   The two-dimensional representation of the palying fields consists of 10 vertical\n   by 15 horizontal positons indicated by grid markings around the perimeter.  The\n   spacefighters will be in their initial positions.\n\n5. Defense/Position Check.\n     Enter number of spacefighter to be examined.\n     S: Current spacefighter being examined.\n     D: Defense strength of current spacefighter.\n     Enter 0 to end defense/position check phase.\n\n6. Program Spacefighters.\n   Surviving spacefighters are programmed in ascending order.  Enter 0 to begin\n   programming first spacefighter.  Defense strength and position are shown during\n   programming.\n     E: indicates number of enteries left after current command.\n     C: indicates time remaining to program current fighter if clock was entered.\n\n    COMMAND   FUNCTION\n      1        Rotate 45 ccw, Move fwd\n      2        Move fwd\n      3        Rotate 45 cw, Move fwd\n      4        Rotate 45 ccw\n      5        Fire\n      6        Rotate 45 cw\n      B        Erase all commands and reprogram current spacefighter\n      E        End programming of current spacefighter\n      7-A,C,D,F  Rest, No operation\n      0        Rest, Begin programming next spacefighter\n\n   Enter 0 to begin programming each successive spacefighter.\n\n7. Execute Commands.\n   Enter 0 after all spacefighters are programmed to start execution of commands.\n\n8. The recommended starting point when tryint the game out is with 1 or 2 spacefighters,\n   any defense, F (15) entries per round, no clock, F (15) fire power and any accumulation\n      S: 1 or 2\n      D: 1\n      E: F\n      C: 0\n      F: F\n      A: 0\n\n   Use the above to try out the movement and fire execution of the fighters.  Try\n   performing loops, figure 8's, tight turns, maximum fire coverage techniques, etc.\n   Start out simple when first playing the game against an opponent.  \n   Eight spacefighters can get very complicated.\n\n9. Changing different parameters creates very different effects on the play of the game.\n   The main effect of a large number of fighters is a more complicated game.  A large\n   number of enteries per round results in a more lively game involving farsighted\n   planning.  Fewer enteries involves more thinking and reacting to immediate developments\n   but is not without strategy when there are multiple fighters opposing each other.\n   The clock provides pressure which can be greatly increased by the moves-to-time ratio.\n   More fire power increases the importance of movement and positioning.  Accumulation\n   of fire power can have long range effects if there is low fire power and a large\n   number of moves per round.\n",

    "description": "SYZYGY v0.1\n\nOne of the first games I remember playing on a computer was \ncalled \"syzygy\" on a now ancient TRS-80 Model 1.  It has since\nappeared on other computers under various names.  Why it was\ncalled syzygy, I have no idea (consult Websters).  However, since\nthe HP48SX has approximately the same memory, graphics and cpu\npower as my TRS-80 did (something like 16kB, 128x64, and a 1.2Mhz Z80),\nI thought it would be amusing to play it again.  Now, approximately\nto my recollection, and with many apologies to the original author,\nhere is a CHIP48 version of SYZYGY.  Enough drivel.\n\nThe object of the game is to seek out \"targets\".  You do this with\nyour syzygy.  Initially small, the syzygy will grow by some amount\neach time a target is hit.  Eventually, your syzygy will\nbe so long as to make tougher and tougher to get any points (and easier\nand easier to get killed).  Confused?  Just try it.\n\nAnyways, the syzygy is not allowed to run into anything except targets.\nIt cannot run into the screen border (if present), or itself (this \nincludes backing into itself).  Fast and immediate death will result.\nDon't worry if you die quickly a few times.  The keys take a few \nminutes to get used to.\n\nTo start:     +      start/restart game with border\n              -      start/restart borderless game\n       \nTo play:      9      up\n              6      down\n              1      left\n              2      right\n\n[Hint for frustrated beginners: hold left hand on 1 & 2, and right hand on\n 6 & 9 keys.

I was\ninspired by the lack enjoyable games for our favorite handheld.  [Not since the\nGoodies Disks have been available!  -jkh-]  This game, though it lacks some of\nthe whistles and bangs of fancy versions, performs on par with quality arcade\nversions (nota bene -> SPEED).  At my college, every person who picks up my\ncalculator is immediately hooked for hours.\n\nThis version is written for the CHIP48 game interpreter (c)\ncopyright 1990 Andreas Gustafsson.  \n\nThe 4 key is left rotate, 5 - left move, 6 - right move, 1\n- drop, ENTER - restart, DROP - end.  After every 5 lines, the speed\nincreases slightly and peaks at 45 lines.\n\nThere is room for improvement in this version.  Notably, background\npictures, a pause key (for now, hold ON), two rotate keys, various\nstarting skill levels, a B version which starts with randomn blocks,\nfinishing graphics, and high scores, just to name a few.\n\nIn order for improvements, I need to know if there is reasonable\ndemand.

So even clearing and redrawing a few dots will cause the framerate to drop to near zero :) Originally the demo was going to be bigger and there were much more graphical effects programmed/prototyped, but a lot of these effects turned out to be too much for the original unoptimized Chip-8 interpreters to handle. \n\nRunning the Demo:\n-----------------\nUse the Megachip emulator or any other Chip-8/SuperChip compatible emulator to run the slideshow.\n\nCredits:\n--------\nProgramming/Graphics/Design by: Martijn Wenting\n\nDistribution:\n-------------\nThis package can be freely distributed in its original form.\nIf you would like to include this slideshow in your rom package, please let me know.\n\nWatch out for more releases soon!\n\n\n\tMartijn Wenting / Revival Studios\n\n",

You\ncan shoot in three directions; left diagonal, straight up, and right\ndiagonal.. using the keys 4, 5, and 6 respectively.. You try to hit\none of two objects flying by.. at apparently varying speeds..  Your\nscore is displayed on your left, the number of missles you have left\nis displayed on your right. (You get 15)..\n\nThis game (\"UFO\") is not new.  I have a copy of it from 1977 (!).  It\nwas one of the original CHIP-8 games on the audio cassette that was\nincluded when I bought my first computer, the Finnish-made Telmac\n1800.\n\nIt was also the first real program to run under CHIP-48 (it was used\nas a test case during the development of the CHIP-48 interpreter). The\nreason I have not posted it to the net myself is that I have no idea\nabout its copyright status.  I don't even know where it originated\n(RCA, perhaps?).\n\nThe cassette that was bundled with the Telmac 1800 contains more than\na dozen CHIP-8 programs.  If someone could convince me that these\nprograms are indeed freely redistributable, the other programs could\nalso be posted.  Otherwise, perhaps this one shouldn't have been.\n",

To work well, it \nneeds a Scroll Screen call-to-subroutine, which is not (yet) supported by Octo. But \nit can be modified as such to work on the old machines, at which point it should be \nplayable. \n\nIt would be nice if Octo supported Call-To-Subroutine Machine Language functionality \n(I suggest RCA CDP 1802 emulation). Or, at the very least, an \"Add-On Subroutine Pack\" \nsimulation, that gives us additional features, like a Scroll Screen Left/Right X1, X2 \nand Up/Down Y1, Y2 call, and even Non-XOR Set/Reset Pixel, XOR and Non-XOR X1, Y1 to \nX2, Y2 Draw/Clear Line, Non-XOR Display Sprite, and possibly some other nice features \nlike that. (these are the routines I will/would write if I could) Maybe next year.\n\n\n\nControls:\n---------\n5 = Up\n7 = Left\n8 = Down\n9 = Right\n\n",

No consideration is made for whether there\n were other valid moves available. The player may press any key to start again.\n\n## Notes\nThe game runs best at 30 cycles/sec or faster.

In honour of the first computer that ran Chip-8, the Cosmac VIP, and its related magazine, the VIPer, I figured it was time for a viper version of 3D Monster Maze, and so last year I created 3D Viper Maze for Octojam 7.\n\nThe intention I had with 3D Viper Maze, although written using XO-Chip instructions to make it more fun as a game, was always to create a version of the game that can run on the original Cosmac VIP Chip-8 interpreter. This simplified version became 3D VIP'r Maze, and that is what you're looking at.\n\nThis version of the game runs at 30 cycles per frame, at the original resolution, in the space of 3.2K of memory, using the original instruction set. It's a game with an endless supply of randomly generated mazes, just like its namesake. The levels are generated in Chip-8, so you will have to be a little patient ;) Unfortunately there wasn't enough space to add any vipers this time around.\n\nYour challenge, if you accept it: to find the exit in each maze! How far down the maze can you get?\n\nIf you're interested in the challenges I had to overcome to make this game fit and run on the original Cosmac VIP, check out my development notes on Github!",

This time it uses the new features \n(i.e. scrolling and full-screen graphics) that were added in SUPER-CHIP V1.1.\n\nThe game\n--------\nDue to lack of imagination, I did a very wellknown game. Alien, one of the \nfirst games I played in the beginning of the C=64 era. It is a rather simple\nshoot'em up game and the story behind the game is as follows: Unfriendly\n(most aliens are) aliens have invaded the earth and the only one who can stop \nthem are you. To assist you in your battle, the russian experts have \ndeveloped a new powerful (and leathal) weapon, the blaster. But, as you\nknown, the Rubel isn't what it used to be and therefore, the scientists could \nonly afford the version with limited firecapacity. You can only have one shot \nin the air at the same time. And what's even worse: the aliens have gotten \nhold of the very same weapon. And they're continually making their shields \nstronger and stronger. Stop them before they reach mother earth!\n\nHow to start the game\n---------------------\nUpload the game to your HP48-series calulcator via the serial cable. Make \nsure the you also have got S-CHIP V1.1 somewhere in your machine (otherwise \nyou'll have to upload that too). Press the Alien menu-key and a string will \nappear in the first level of the stack (the only thing readable is my name). \nThen press the S-Chip menu-key and the game will begin.

Destroy as many aliens as you can before they hit the ground to give your fellow \nhuman being a fighting chance! 👽\n\nFor each alien spaceship you shoot down, you gain points (shown on the top left, indicated with \"PTS\"). If you let \nalien ships escape and get down to the planet, you lose points. For every 250 points you collect, you go up a level \n(current level shown bottom left, indicated with \"LVL\"). But beware! Each level, the attacks get more fierce!\n\nYour ship does not have unlimited power. The power meter (white indicator on the left of the playfield, which turns \nred) shows you how much power your ship has left. Shooting your lasers takes power, and if you lose power your lasers \nwill be less powerful. More importantly, your power also feeds your shields. If you run your ship into alien ships, \nyour shield will compensate and draw power. Lose all your power and you lose your shields, leaving you vulnerable to \nthe alien ships!\n\nGood luck Gunnar, and may lady luck smile on you!\nThe concept\n\nAlien inv8sion is a nod to the endless stream of space shooters that popped up in the late 70s and early 80s after \nthe popularity of the game Space Invaders from 1978. This is very much the exact same period in which CHIP-8 became \npopular, and there are a lot of Space Invaders clones and other space shooters for CHIP-8. Time to add my twist on \nthe theme to the fray!\n\nHaving recently developed a WebAssembly CHIP-8, SCHIP and XO-CHIP interpreter called Silicon8 that supports the full \nrange of XO-CHIPs potential colour space  (a whole whopping 16 colours!) I figured it would be a shame not to make \nuse of those colours in my next game. So I did, and I bumped the virtual CPU speed to an absolutely insane 12Mhz to \nbring CHIP-8 (or more specifically XO-CHIP) much closer to the coveted arcade systems of the time, or even systems \nlike the NES.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have very much time to work on this game this year, and the actual gameplay may not be what \nyou expect from an arcade or NES game. But it's fun to fly around and shoot aliens, and as a demo of what CHIP-8 \ncan do if pushed: a fully animated colourful parallax background with lots of masked sprites flying across the screen!\n\nFor more background information and the source code, see the Github repository.\n\n",

Each has some number of troops \nstationed there (1-5). At the beginning of the game, territories are divided between you \n(white) and an AI opponent (black).\n\nYou can order your territories to attack adjacent enemy territories provided you have more \nthan one troop available. When you attack, a number of 8-sided dice will be rolled and summed \nbased on the number of attackers and defenders. If the attackers win, they capture the \nterritory and transfer all but one of their troops over. If the defenders win, they destroy \nall but one of the attackers and lose one troop, or none if they have only a single troop.\n\nAfter white has taken a turn, each territory has a 50% chance of producing one new troop. \nThe game ends when black or white has conquered the entire map.\n\nWhen selecting a territory, 5/7/8/9 (ASWD) move your cursor, 6 (E) selects the territory \nand 4 (Q) ends your turn. With a territory selected, 5/7/8/9 (ASWD) choose the direction in \nwhich to attack, 6 (E) confirms the attack and 4 (Q) cancels. When the game is over press \nany key to play again.\n\n",

The 4x4 operator grid on screen corresponds directly to the layout of the keypad. Numeric input \nis always a 16-bit hexadecimal integer. You can store up to four values at a time. Try to add another one beyond that, \nand the program crashes and runs the buzzer until you restart the emulator.\n\nLegend\n\n    +: Adds the bottom two values of the stack\n    -: Subtracts the bottom value from the value above\n    ×: Multiplies the bottom two values of the stack*\n    ÷: Divides the second-from-bottom value by the bottom value*\n    S: Computes the sine of the bottom value of the stack*\n    C: Computes the cosine of the bottom value of the stack*\n    T: Computes the tangent of the bottom value of the stack*\n    √: Computes the square root of the bottom value of the stack\n    S⁻¹: Computes the inverse sine of the bottom value of the stack\n    C⁻¹: Computes the inverse cosine of the bottom value of the stack\n    T⁻¹: Computes the inverse tangent of the bottom value of the stack\n    🗘: Swaps the bottom two values of the stack\n    #: Add a value to the bottom of the stack\n    ⌫: Remove a value from the bottom of the stack\n    <<: Shift the bottom value of the stack one bit to the left\n    >>: Shift the bottom value of the stack one bit to the right\n\n*These functions require one or more inputs to be only 8 bits, so if the input value is >0xFF it gets shifted 8 bits to \nthe right.\n\n",

The amount of title screen animation explains for its\nrather large size for a S-CHIP game of 700 some odd bytes.  However, it is\nstill amazing to me that a game as simple as this can be written in so few\nbytes!\n\nTo play press the \".\" key during the title sequence, you may have to hold it\ndown for a second or two since I don't check keypresses between every single\nframe of animation.\n\nThe screen will then appear like:\n _________________________\n|#                       #|\n|                         |   .----ASTEROIDS\n|#                        |   |\n|                        #<---'\n|                         |\n|#_______________________#|\n\nThe keys are now defined as:\n\n1 - Apply thrust to the left ( so you move right! )\n2 - Apply thrust to the right ( so you move left! )\n/ - Move up\n* - Move Down\n7 - Abandon Game and return to the Title Screen\n\nNow once the game is going.(you must apply thrust to actually start.)\nThe screen appears like this.\n _________________________\n|#         #             #|\n|     +-           #      |                 \n|#    ^          #        |    \n|  #  |   #              #|    \n|     |           #       |\n|#____|__________________#|\n      |\n     You\n\n\nNow your on your on... Just don't hit anything.\n\nYour score is based on how long you last, actually it is more of a rating\nthan a score, and it is revealed to you by the OWL on the Title screen.  \n\n0-F (In HEX cause that was easier to do, and since this is my FIRST chip \nprogram, I think you can be happy with that, anyway it will probably only be \nby an act of God that you make it very far.)\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nLet me know if you like it, or if there are any bugs, or you want more.\nI would greatly appreciate hearing from any of you HP48sx whizes.\nThis horizontal scrolling looks tremendously like DEFENDER and perhaps\nthat is where this program will go!.\n\n\n\t\t** Notes about this program **\nIf you think the game is too slow, let me know. It is loaded with delays; it\ngoes so fast you can't see a thing if you take out the delays. (Idea...\nrelease version with variable speed control.)\n\nSince I don't have a PC and didn't feel like downloading CHIPPER,\nI had to write my own PSEUDO-COMPILER/ASSEMBLER/LINKER.  I did this and\nwrote this game to test it yesterday.  What a long day it was!\n\nThe main reason it is just a PSEUDO-COMPILER is that the code generated by \nBISON on one of the Fish Disks just won't compile! So the Parser is integrated\ninto the Scanner(thanks FLEX.)  Since it is a two step Compile(SYMTAB Build, \nOBJ Generation) a linker was needed to create the S-CHIP V1.1 executable.\nAll these are now working in one 20K executable Amiga Program. \nThis is all written based solely on the CHIP48 docs (scanty at best) and I'm\nstill not quite sure how to do everything.\n\nI'll try to post this program later today, once I write the DOCS.  \n\nI think you folks should like it, because the source doesn't look like\nassembler.\n\n\nAnyway, thanks go to Andreas Gustafsson for the excellent!!! chip interpreter,\n\t\t\t\t\t        ------------\nand to Erik Bryntse for his modifications that resulted in the even more\nexcellent!

    "description": "\nFLIP-8: Think-a-Dot edition\n===========================\nby Tobias V. Langhoff (octojam 7)\n\n\nAbout:\n------\nThis is a version of Joseph Weisbecker's game Think-a-Dot (1965) aka. Flip (1974) implemented in Weisbecker's \nown CHIP-8 language for the COSMAC VIP computer (1977) he designed while at RCA.\n\n\nHow to Play:\n------------\nPress 1, 2 or 3 to drop a marble into the respective hole. The marble will move through the flip-flops, moving \neither left or right at each one depending on its state, flipping the ones it hits before popping out on the \nbottom. Play around with it on the title screen to get a feel for how it works, or make up your own game around \nits rules.\n\nYou can always press 4 to reset back to the starting layout.\n\nPress any of the following keys to generate a random goal pattern, displayed to the right:\n\n- R: New game from random layout (shake)\n- F: New game from default layout (tilt left)\n- V: New game from inverted layout (tilt right)\n\n\nTWO PLAYER MODE:\n----------------\nYou can also play with a friend. Choose who goes first, player 1 or player 2; after that, you can continue \ndropping the marble as long as the marble comes out on your side (watch the arrows at the bottom). Your goal \npatterns are inverts of each other.\n\nFor convenience, start playing by pressing any of the following keys to display both patterns:\n\n- E: New game from random layout (shake)\n- D: New game from default layout (tilt left)\n- C: New game from inverted layout (tilt right)\n\n\nHISTORY:\n--------\nIn 1965, Joseph A. Weisbecker invented an educational mechanical toy computer called the Think-a-Dot\n(https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/patents/us3388483.pdf), which was manufactured by E.S.R., Inc. In 1974, \nWeisbecker detailed a design for an electronic CMOS computer version of the game, called Flip, in the \nmagazine Popular Electronics. In 1977, Weisbecker's simple programming language CHIP-8 was introduced for \nRCA's COSMAC VIP microcomputer, which was also based on his designs. Read more in The Sarnoff Collection's \narticle on Think-a-Dot. (https://davidsarnoff.tcnj.edu/2017/12/10/object-of-the-week-think-a-dot/)\n\n\nMATHEMATICS:\n------------\nThink-a-Dot was covered in Mathematics Magazine in 1967, 1973 and 1979. The game has some interesting characteristics. \nFor example, as proven by Benjamin L. Schwartz in his paper \"Mathematical Theory of Think-A-Dot\" published in \nMathematics Magazine, Vol. 40, No. 4 (Sep., 1967): When playing Think-A-Dot, it's impossible to flip an even number \nof spots. Try it yourself! No wonder: It always flips one spot in both the top and bottom row. This of course means \nthat if your starting pattern has an even number of flipped spots in those two rows, you can never reach a pattern \nwith an odd number of flipped spots � and vice versa. In computing, we say that you can't change the pattern's parity.\n\nThis also means that from the default starting position, only half of the possible patterns can be reached. Interestingly, \nthis includes inverting the default pattern, since the total number of spots in the top and bottom rows is even (6).\n\nInterestingly, the original instruction booklet for Think-a-Dot listed 20 goal patterns for the starting pattern when \ntilting to the left, and 20 goal patterns for tilting to the right. But they were all from the same possibility space!\n\nFLIP-8 takes this limitation into account when generating random goal patterns: Any pattern you get can always be \nsolved. You can also randomize the starting pattern completely, gaining access to the other half of the possible goal \npatterns.\n\nYou can read more about the mathematics behind the game on Jaap's Puzzle Page on Think-a-Dot.\nhttps://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/thinkadot.htm\n\n",

Piper! for SUPER-CHIP follows below.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Since CHIP makes use of undocumented features\nof the HP48SX, anything can happen: loss of data, meltdown,\netc. Therefore, I take no responsibility for any damage\nwhatsoever that occurs.\n\n****************  H. Piper!  **********************\n\nOBJECT:\n-------\nYou are presented with a 6 row, 10 column grid and\na preview panel of 5 pipes. A starting pipe will be\nplaced on the grid and will in a few seconds start\nleaking.  The object is to lay pipes on the grid to\ncontain the leak as long as you can.  If the water\nflows onto an empty grid site, onto the side of another\npipe or border, that plumbing job is finished.  If you\ndid well enough, you may get another job.  Otherwise\nthe game is over.\n\nSTARTING THE GAME:\n-----------------\nMake sure you have the SCHIP program on the calculator.\nPress HPIPER to recall the program string to the stack.\nThen press SCHIP to start the game.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n------------\nOn the bottom and right borders of the grid are grid\npointers.  The bottom pointer can be moved left with\nthe (1) key and right with the (2) key.  The side\npointer can be moved up with the (9) key and down with\nthe (6) key. (Note: this is identical to the movement\nkeys for Syzygy by Roy Trevino)  A crosshair is present\non the grid sites the two paddles point to.\n\nUsing the pointers, chose a grid site to place a pipe.\nThe pipe to be placed is the one at the bottom of\nthe preview column. Once a site is chosen, press the\n(7) or (4) key to place the pipe there.  You can replace\na pipe already at the grid site with a penalty of one\npoint.  You cannot replace a pipe that the water has\nalready flown through.  Trying to do this will make\nyou lose the pipe you were trying to place and also\npenalize you one point.\n\nThe two buttons used to place pipe differ in the way\nthat the next pipe added at the top of the queue.\nPressing (7) will choose a random new pipe to place\nat the top of the preview column and push the others\ndown the queue.  Pressing (4) will use the pipe\ncurrently displayed to the right of the grid as the\nnew pipe to be placed at the top of the preview\ncolumn.  The pipes on the right cycle through all\ntypes in a set manner.\n\nWhen you have placed all the pipe you wish to for\na particular job, you can press the (+) key to make\nthe water flow *FAST*.  You can still lay pipe if\nyou realize you made a mistake, but hurry!\n\n   KEY SUMMARY:     Left     (1)\n                    Right    (2)\n                    Up       (9)\n                    Down     (6)\n                    Place    (7)  random\n                    Place    (4)  non-random\n                    Fast     (+)\n\nOnce a job is over, press (SPACE) to continue.\n\nThere are twenty levels with increasing water flow speed.\nLevel 20's speed is the same as that for *FAST*. If\nyou manage to get through level 20, it repeats at\nthat level till you fail.  The starting speed with\nwhich the flow comes out of the initial pipe is slower\nthan the usual flow, however this speed increases in\nlevel also. \n\nSCORING:\n--------\nYou receive 3 points for every pipe the water flows\nthrough.  For the crossed pipes, flowing through\nthem in both directions gives you 6 points.\nYou are penalized 1 point for replacing or\ntrying to replace a pipe already on the grid.\n\nThe current job score is shown in upper right corner.\nThe score can not go negative, so if the score is\nzero, you can replace pipes without penalty.\n\nOnce a job is over, the program checks to see if\nevery grid site was flown through. If so you\nearn a 100 point bonus. The score earned is added to\nthe grand total and displayed on the screen shown\nafter (SPACE) is pressed. \n\nIf the game is over, the word OVER will be displayed\nabove the score and the (SPACE) key can be pressed\nto exit. The total score will be written to user \nflags so that the user lang program SCORE can\nput the score on the stack. If over does not appear,\npress (SPACE) to go on to the next job.\nThe points needed to go to the next job are\nobtained by the following formula:\n\n    Points needed = 100 - (41 - 2 * level)\n\ntherefore, you need 63 points to go to job 2\n                    65 points to go to job 3\n                    ...\n                    99 points to go to job 20,21,....\n\nThe points needed for a level are shown below the\nbottom right corner of a grid.  Note that this\ndoes not mean that play ends once that score\nis achieved.  That score is only a minimum needed\nto have the opportunity to continue on another job.\n\nRESUME:\n-------\nBetween jobs (i.e. while at the dripping faucet wait\nscreen) you can press the decimal (.) key to leave\nthe game and go to the regular calculator mode.  The\ntotal score and level you achieved will be stored in\nthe user flags so that next time you start the game,\nyou will resume the game as you left it.  Do not\nrun the SCORE program or you will lose the resumable\nstate.\n\nIf somehow the user flags get messed up by other\nprograms you run after pausing, you can set them\nusing the HPSET program.  Put the desired score\non level 2 and the game level you just completed\non level 1. Once you get really good at the game,\nyou can use this to bypass the first few really\nslow screens. For example, to start off on level 9,\nenter 0 then 8 and run HPSET. When you start the\ngame, you will begin at level 10.\n\nRANDOMNESS:\n----------\nThe starting pipe for the first level is still \nplaced randomly.  For subsequent levels, however,\nthe starting pipe is located on the grid site\nyou \"leaked\" on with the starting direction opposite\nof that you entered.  If you leaked onto the border,\nthen the starting pipe is placed on the site you\nleaked from.\n\nThe first five pipes in the queue are selected randomly.\n\nOTHER REMARKS:\n-------------\n-- The [ENTER] key will now work to restart\n   the game as if it was just run for the first time.\n-- The movement keys can now be held down to\n   move the crosshair long distances.\n-- Corner pieces are guaranteed for the first four\n   pipes to get out of sticky situations with\n   the starting pipe placement.\n\nTROUBLE SHOOTING:\n----------------\nSome people have reported assorted problems with\ngetting the program to work.  For those who can't get\nSCHIP to work with H. Piper, try turning off all alarms\nand date/clock displays.  If you have Chipper,\nyou might try compiling the source code yourself and\nsee if you can get it to run from there.  \n\n\nDEVELOPMENT NOTES:\n-----------------\nPipe Graphics --\n   As you will probably notice, a lack of\n   color is a big problem in trying to sort\n   out what you have laid out.  Having 8x8\n   pipe bitmaps was a cornerstone of my\n   design so enlarging them for better\n   resolution would be difficult and probably\n   restrict the grid size unduly.\n\nRandomness    --\n   Just how random is S-CHIP's random generator?\n   You will probably notice that the cross pipe\n   comes up more often than the others. True. It\n   is twice as likely to be chosen than any of\n   the others.  Another design fluke. However,\n   being the one true symmetrical piece, it\n   will be the most useful to get often.\n\nProgram Size  --\n   I've put a semi-rigid limit of 2K on the size\n   of the program.

The main difference is the sprite\nbitmaps.  Although I didn't use the bit maps given to me by Steve VanDevender,\nI thank him for his insights into the game.  It's kind of funny the way this\ngame developed.  I wasn't really sure of the details of the game.  I had to go\non memory.  Gosh, I think Joust was introduced in something like 1981 or '82.\nI do remember dumping a couple pounds of quarters into that game.  Joust had\npretty good graphics in its day, but I suppose Game Boy graphics can beat it\nnow (not considering color).\n\nDo try this version (if you liked the others at all).  The new bitmaps have\nmore of the \"Joust Spirit\".\n\nNote: Although the player and rival sprites are definitely different, it's\n      easy to get them mixed up and die quickly.  I use the rival soldier's\n      blank ankle to distinguish the sprites.\n\nThe Game\n========\n\n                      /   =   right\n                      9   =   left\n                      0   =   up, start game, and replay\n\n                      points:     1 per egg\n                                  8 extra for clearing the bonus round\n                                  bonus player for winning bonus round\n\nBeware - due to the new bitmaps the bonus round is tougher, but do-able.\n         Call it a bug or call it a challenge.\n\n\n                       Have More Fun,\n\n                                         Zoom\n                                         catto@ecn.purdue.edu\n\nP.S.  Sorry no programming notes; I'm working on a new game which uses the\n      scrolling features of S-Chip v1.1 (my selfish priorities)\n      I will answer questions via e-mail.\n\nDo-able Chip games:      Defender, Berzerk (easy, no collisions allowed)\n                         Birds-eye view Car Racing, Scramble, Vanguard,\n                         Asteroids (tricky), Donkey Kong, Frogger, Pinball\n\n\n-To run Joust v2.2 you must have S-Chip v1.0 or v1.1.  Download it, recall the\nresult to the stack.  Execute SCHIP.  Press 0 to start.\n\n----------\n  Resp: 1 of 1 by _falco at hpcvbbs.UUCP\nAuthor: [Andrey Dolgachev]\n  Date: Wed Jun 05 1991\n\nErin,\n\nGreat work on Joust but I have a couple of comments.  One bug I've noticed is\nthat if you kill a buzzard right over one of the ledges, the egg goes through\nthe ledge.  Otherwise, I haven't noticed any problems and I think its a great\ngame.  Now how about that hand sticking out of the lava?  Regarding future CHIP\ngames, I would love to start writing some CHIP programs, since I see a lot more\npotential in CHIP than in RPL or even ML.\n\n    Keep up the good work,\n           --Falco\n\n----------\n  Resp: 1 of 1 by catto at author.ecn.purdue.edu\nAuthor: [Erin S Catto]\n  Date: Sat Jun 08 1991\n\nDan Stephenson writes:\n\n>BUGS:\n>\n>The eggs sometimes fall through a level.\n>The bouncing eggs sometimes forget to fall when they go past a ledge.\n>The bonus round IS goofy. Sometimes I whiz right THROUGH eggs!\n\nFor my version of Joust I decided to let the eggs fall thru the ledge if the\nrival jouster is right above the ledge.  Why?  One, it was easier this way, and\ntwo, it makes the game more challenging because you have to chase the egg (the\nonly item worth points).\n\nTo save on space I used the same routine that keeps the jousters on the ledge\nto make the eggs bounce.  Now the jousters are wider than the eggs but S-CHIP\ndoesn't know that; so when an egg bounces off the left edge of a platform it\nappears to make one bounce in mid-air.  I could fix this but I don't think it\nimpacts the game enough to merit the effort.\n\nOn the bonus round; yes, due to the new bitmaps of v2.2 the bonus round isn't\nquite right.  I think I will fix this, but until then you can pick up the eggs\nby moving across them coming from the left.\n\nDan also mentioned a number of features that would help my Joust more fully\nemulate the original Joust.  However, having twenty revisions to this game does\nnot interest me.  Especially now since I'm working on another S-CHIP game which\nwill feature scrolling and animation.  It will be an action/adventure game with\nchanging perspectives.  The new scrolling features of S-CHIP v1.1 are\nincredible!  They add so much potential to game writing.\n\n\n                                                   Zoom\n                                                   catto@ecn.purdue.edu\n\u001a",

To play\n       again, just reset the emulator.\n\n       I know I could have implemented some sort of inversions\n       counter, and next-level playing after a level is finished,\n       but I missed some time to do this... Anyway, have fun !\n\n       I could also have given the source of this program, but it\n       is not documented, so it would not be interesting to those\n       who are looking for help in programming.\n\n\n       The keys are:\n                   [8] :   UP\n                   [4] :   LEFT (lower level under level selection)\n                   [5] :   INVERT SQUARE (start game under level selection)\n                   [6] :   RIGHT (upper level under level selection)\n                   [2] :   DOWN\n",

If you paid to have it, you have been stolen. If you got money to give it, you're a thief.\n\n\n\nThe rules of this game are very simple: the game is played on a 18*9 squares playing field. On this playing field, some squares are MINED, some others are not. The goal is to find all the non mined ones. To do so, you just move around a cursor, and check the squares you want. If the square you're checking is mined, you lost, and all the mines are shown. If not, the game puts a number on the square, which tells how many mines are placed around it (if there are no mines around, the square is blanked). It is to you to make the logic deductions to find the non mined squares. To help you, the game allows putting marks on the squares which are believed to be mined.\n\nThe keys are:\n[8] :   UP\n[4] :   LEFT (lower level under level selection)\n[5] :   SHOW SQUARE (start game under level selection)\n[6] :   RIGHT (upper level under level selection)\n[2] :   DOWN\n[*] :   MARK SQUARE AS MINED\n",

    "description": "\nPatrick's CHIP-8 Challenge - by Tobias V. Langhoff (2019)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemove all 28 squares from the board in a never-ending series of randomized puzzles.\n\nPATRICK�S CHIP-8 CHALLENGE is fun for all ages. Are you ready for the challenge?\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n-------------\nThe object of the game is to move Patrick around the board and remove all 28 squares. \nSquares with symbols on them will remove extra squares (as indicated by the symbols), \nand can make the puzzles trickier, but also reduce the number of steps needed.\n\n\nCONTROLS:\n---------\nPatrick can move to any adjacent square, even diagonally. If you�re using an ASCII \nkeyboard rather than a COSMAC VIP hexadecimal keyboard, the following keys are used \nfor movement:\n\nQ W E\nA   D\nZ X C\n\n\nHISTORY:\n--------\nThe original Patrick's Challenge was an unfinished text adventure for the Commodore 64, \ncreated by Reldni Productions. In June of 1996, Patrick's Challenge for Windows 95 was \nreleased. It was a puzzle game, and bore no resemblance to the original Commodore game. \nIn 1998, Troy Scott and Reldni released the sequel, Patrick's Challenge II, which this \nfanmade game is a port of.\n\n",

    "description": "\nShooth3rd - by Beholder (2016)\n------------------------------\nOctoJam 3\n\n\nYou play as the shooter on the left side of the screen trying to hit the target on the right side. \nYour goal is to hit the target while bouncing against obstacles as little as possible. Each time \nyou bounce against an obstacle you lose 1 point.\n\n4(Q) and 7(A) will move the shooter's position up and down.\n\n5(W) and 8(S) will change the bullet angle. There are 7 angles you can shoot from:\n\nAngle 0 moves the bullet twice on the Y axis then on the X axis.\n\nAngle 1 moves the bullet equally on both axis.\n\nAngle 2 moves the bullet twice on the X axis then on the Y axis.\n\nAngle 3 moves the bullet straight only on the X axis.\n\nAngle 4, 5 & 6 are the same as 0, 1 & 2 but with Y axis direction inverted.\n\n6(E) shoots.\n\n9(D) stops the bullet and reset the player so you can shoot again. That's needed when you're stuck \ninto an infinite loop.\n\n11(Z) will reset the level and re-generate a new set of random obstacles. This option is helpful \nin case the player believes the level is unbeatable.\n\nWhen you hit the target you advance to the next level. Each time you advance a level you gain 5 points. \nLevel 1 starts with 1 obstacle. Each new level adds 1 obstacle to a max of 9 per screen. When you beat \na level with 9 obstacles the target gets smaller and obstacles are reset to 1. There are 4 target sizes, \neach with 9 levels, adding to a total of 36 levels. There's a + sign object that changes the bullet \nangle to make it a bit more random. You win 1 point each time you hit the + sign. It's fun to shoot \nstraight at it :) Max score is 100, can you beat the game at 100? sounds quite impossible, but if you \ndo so you'll see a cat sprite as a reward!!! If you score 95 or higher you'll see a bunny. You can win \nor lose a max of 25 points per level. There's a known bug where if the bullet hits the frame above or \nbellow an obstacle... it will go past through it. I left it there in case players want to exploit this \nbug. Aaaannnddd because im lazy and don�t really wanna fix it :D\n\nThis game is meant to run at 7 cycles so it can run on a Cosmac VIP!\n",

All stages are linked by User-Rpl (Flags determine\nmovement between levels.  The introduction is in User-Rpl.  The Fading\nis courtesy of Mr.Meuller (I think...I hope - please correct me if I am wrong)\nwhich was written in System-Rpl.\n\nEventually, all this stuff will be contained in a library, and will be self\nuncompressing as you reach each stage (for those without RAM cards), using\nof course RFU (System-RPL).\n\n\nPlease take the time to have a brief look and tell me what yu think, what I\ncan do with it .... and most importantly ... WHO CAN GIVE ME A BIT OF A HAND\n(I will finish it, but I will surely finish it much faster with your aide)\n\nHere is what is in the directory:\n[INTRO] - speaks for itself - Introduction (1st half - haven't done the second\n                                        yet)\n[BOMB] - Schip Hex String for Bomber Section (what I have done so far)\n[ST1]  - Schip Hex String for Stages 1-2 (that all I'm going to post for the\n         moment ;])\n[DIE]  - The death sequence\n\nMANY THANKS go to my graphic designer Stuart Fisher, and to [Zoom] for\nhis patience...don't worry Zoom, I will finish it ;].\n\nEnjoy.\nDavid Nurser\nitb675nurser@redgum.qut.edu.au\n\n\nPerhaps the lack of response to Single Dragon is because you couldn't\nfigure out the keys...So far, only one person has expressed interest\n...and to tell the truth, it's rather depressing.\nI will gladly send anyone parts of it personally if they are still\nhaving problems downloading etc.\n\nKeys Are:\n[3] - Up\n[SPC] - Down\n[.] - Left\n[+] - Right\n[7] - Punch\n[8] - Kick\n\nHelicopter Scene:\n[8] - Up\n[2] = Down\n[4] = Left\n[6] = Right\n[5] = Bomb\n\nCaio\nDave.

I was living in Taxco Mexico at the time, and had just also completed writing \nProgrammers Guide to the 1802.\n\nComments appreciated -- Please try my game! \n\n\nControls:\n---------\nUses \"5/7/8/9\" to direct the snake to eat the single-pixel targets. (Perhaps they are mice.) Avoid all \nobstructions. Hitting anything except a target including the snake's own tail loses. \nConsuming all targets on all levels and sub-levels wins. \n\nCan you survive through all six levels? Although easy on lower levels, higher levels are quite challenging \nbecause, on every level and sub-level, the hungry snake grows a little longer and a little faster as it \nfeeds on targets -- I mean mice!\n\n\nTIP:\n----\nRemember that the screen wraps around at the edges! \n\n\nNOTE:\n-----\nTargets are randomly placed using AI to ensure their separation from other objects making every game both \ndifferent and winnable!",

The game\ncontains the original floors, all 50 of them, that have been verified against\nthe 1984 PC version.\n\nIt has been tested, and works fine on my CHIP8 emulator, Fish 'n' Chips,\ncomfortable gameplay is at about 1.2Khz. It has also been successfully tested\non HP48 SCHIP, using EMU48.\n\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n===========\n\n[x]=CHIP8 hexpad key\n{x}=key in a PC emulator that emulates it on 1234/qwer/asdf/zxcv\n\nTitlescreen:\nSelect a floor with [7]{a} and [9]{d}, and enter it with [a]{z}. The floor will\nnow be drawn onto the screen.\n\nGame:\nMove with [5]{w}, [8]{s}, [7]{a}, [9]{d}. You can undo moves up to 57 times\nwith [a]{z}. To restart, hold [0]{x}, and to exit to the titlescreen, restart\nbefore making a move.\n\n\nCREDITS\n=======\n\nFloors were converted to textfiles, these are available all over the internet.\nThanks to whoever converted them in the first place, as I used them to, erm,\nreconvert them. Note that I found some floors containing errors while comparing\nagainst screenshots made from the original Sokoban, though maybe they were\nintentionally changed(?)\n",

TO WIN (say what?)\n  In order to complete this quite difficult task your body (yes only your body\nand not your mind (this remark shows that I believe that the body merely serves\nas a tool for the brain)) have been warped through 87 different time-warps\ndue to some foolish scientists who didn't know what they were doing. This\nresulted in a rather big waste of resources but that's of course another story.\nWhen you finally arrive you can't recognize anything and two weird-looking\ndudes tell you that this is the year 2091!!! Frightening eh?\n  You are of course not very happy about your situation partly because you only\nhave 25 dollars in your wallet and the prizes have gone up about 30000% but\nmainly because IBM and the fucking PC clones have completely taken over all of\nthe computer-market resulting in the Amiga's death!\n  In a Holo-BiDirectional-FullDuplex-TV-store you see a newsflash concerning\nsome evil aliens about to invade the good ol' EARTH. Scientists think that they\nare being drawn towards the Earth due to the massive pollution the PC's cause.\nHowever if people had bought Amiga's instead (which don't pollute) they would\nhave been no aliens now!\n  This is your call! You sneak into a Warp-Transporter without a ticket and you\nend up at NASA where you get to talk to the boss and you tell him : \"OK you\nlisten to me you scumbag! I wanna get into a spacecraft, get up there and KICK\nSOME ALIEN BUTT!\". \"But why?\" the boss says. \"Personal motives\" you answer. If\nyou can save the Amigas existence you're ready to do anything!\n  You get the newest spacecraft (ZX-81) and you take off!!! TO SAVE THE AMIGA!\n  Battle you way through the 6 (increasingly harder) levels!!!\n\n\n\n\nCONTROLLING THE ZX-81\n\n  Though being very advanced the ZX-81 is extremely easy to control:\n\n  HexPad    Amiga    HP    Function\n\n    3         /      9      LEFT\n    C         *      /      RIGHT\n    A         1      0      FIRE\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE GAME\n\n  It was written because I wanted to test my newly written S-Chip assembler for\nthe Amiga. It only took me 2 days to make this game (I'm so proud of myself!).\nI know that some of the code could have been programmed smarter (or smaller!)\nbut then again it was my first attempt so get off my back!\n\n  SourceSize: about 30 k\n  AsmSize:    2840 bytes\n  783 bytes of graphics and 200 bytes of buffers, reducing the codesize to\n  1857 bytes\n\nContact me for anything concerning CHIP like ideas for more games...\n\nSlammer\nCarsten Soerensen\nKronhjortevej 4\nDK-8270  Hoejbjerg\nDenmark\n\nE-Mail: u920659@daimi.aau.dk\n\n",

The demo consists of an intro, 3D vectorballs, and 4 randomized dot-effects.  \n\nWriting a demo for the original Chip-8 interpreter was a real pain, since your framerate basically drops in half for every sprite you need to draw. So even clearing and redrawing a few dots will cause the framerate to drop to near zero :) Originally the demo was going to be bigger and there were much more graphical effects programmed/prototyped, but a lot of these effects turned out to be too much for the original unoptimized Chip-8 interpreters to handle. \n\nRunning the Demo:\n-----------------\nUse the Megachip emulator or any other Chip-8/SuperChip compatible emulator to run the slideshow.\n\nCredits:\n--------\nProgramming/Graphics/Design by: Martijn Wenting\n\nDistribution:\n-------------\nThis package can be freely distributed in its original form.\nIf you would like to include this slideshow in your rom package, please let me know.\n\nWatch out for more releases soon!\n\n\n\tMartijn Wenting / Revival Studios\n\n",

It consists \nof an ant that moves over a grid of pixels. Depending on the current pixel's color (limited to two colors \nin this implementation) and the ant's internal state, it can rotate, change its state, and/or change the \ncolor of the pixel before moving. From these simple rules, interesting patterns and behaviors emerge.\n\n\nControls:\n---------\n* \"5/7/8/9\" to move in menu.\n* \"B\" = Select\n* \"F\" and \"E\" = adjust speed\n* \"A\" = return to menu\n\n",

    "release": "1994",

    "description": " Subject:  U-BOAT v1.0  (c)1994 Michael D. Kemper\nReleased:  v1.0 - 8/8/94\nRequires:  S-CHIP interpreter which can be found on Joseph Horn's\n           goodies disk 3.\n\nThis game is based on a game that I used to play back in the early 80's\non an Apple ][.  I believe the name of the program was \"Depth Charge.\"\nUnfortunately I don't know who was responsible for programming it.\n\nThe premise of the game is fairly simple.  You are the Captain of a sub\nhunting destroyer, and your objective is to sink as many enemy U-Boats as\nyou can.  Your only weapon against the U-Boats is your ship's supply of\ndepth charges.  You have an unlimited supply of charges but, due to the\namount of time it takes your second rate crew to reload, you may only have\nfour charges in the water at any given time.\n\nThe subs that you are hunting appear at random depths and have one of\nthree random velocities (stopped, ahead half, or ahead full).\nThere are six enemy subs visible at any one time.  When one of these\nsubs is destroyed, another will appear at a different location.\n\nThe keys used are as follows:\n\n     [1]     ship's speed full stop\n     [2]     ship's speed ahead half\n     [3]     ship's speed ahead full\n     [-]     drop depth charge\n     [/]     abort game\n     [+/-]   toggle sound\n     [<-]    exit program\n     [Enter] restart program\n\nScoring for the game is based on the depth of the sub, multiplied by one\nplus it's velocity.  For example:\nIf a sub is at a depth of 50, and he is stopped then he is worth 50 points.\nA sub at the same depth of 50, but moving at 1/2 speed is worth 100 points.\nA sub at a depth of 50, but moving at full speed is worth 150 points.\n\nThe time limit for the game is about 2.5 minutes.  At about 1:45 into the\ngame a warning buzzer goes off and an almost empty hourglass is displayed\nby your score to let you know that the game is about over.\n\nOnce the game is over your score, the high score, the number of charges\ndropped, the number of subs hit, and your hit percentage are displayed.\n\nA good game is about 2800 or so, and a really good game is around 3500.  I\nhaven't had a whole lot of time to play it, but my high is 3551.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to Erik Bryntse for his S-CHIP interpreter, which was an extension\nto Andreas Gustafsson's CHIP-48 interpreter.  Thanks also to Christian\nEgeberg for his CHIPPER v2.11 assembler.  A big thanks to Joseph Horn for\ncollecting various HP48 programs and utilities.  His goodies files are just\nabout my only source of information on this fascinating calculator.\n\nIf there are any questions, comments or criticism's they can be emailed\nto mikek@access.mountain.net\n\nThis game is freeware, and may be distributed freely as long as this doc\nfile remains with it, and both the doc and program remain unchanged.  If\nyou find that you become wildly addicted to U-BOAT and can't sleep at\nnight knowing that I didn't receive any compensation for writing it then\nby all means send me enough to allow you to get your z's.\n\n============================================================================\nDisclaimer:\n     This program uses \"Super-Chip\" which makes use of undocumented\n     low-level features of the HP48 calculator, and may or may not\n     cause loss of data, excessive battery drainage, and/or damage to\n     the calculator hardware.  The author takes no responsibility\n     whatsoever for any damage caused by the use of this program.\n============================================================================",
